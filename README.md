## Overview üìã
This comprehensive project represents the culmination of year-end efforts. Designed as a robust solution, it efficiently manages vast amounts of data with precision, elevating the dental surgery it serves to a pinnacle of excellence. Key features include appointment scheduling, patient records management, and real-time updates for medical practitioners.

## Objectives üéØ
- **Streamline Data Management**: Replace time-consuming paper-based systems with efficient digital processes.
- **Enhance Security**: Implement data encryption, password protection, and input validation to safeguard sensitive data.
- **Ensure Data Integrity**: Regular backups and data recovery procedures ensure uninterrupted operations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Medical practitioners can easily access and update schedules in real-time.
- **Automated Reporting**: Management benefits from automated facility request processing and streamlined reporting.
- **Accurate Calculations**: Transition from manual to computerized methods for improved precision.
- **Patient Access**: Patients can securely view and download their medical records.

### Pre-Implementation Process
Before implementing this solution, dental center operations relied heavily on manual processes for appointment scheduling, patient data recording, and treatment management. These methods were time-consuming and prone to errors, often requiring significant staff intervention.

## Operations üîß
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Previously handled manually by staff, doctor availability and patient appointments are now seamlessly managed through the system.
- **Patient Records**: Medical records, once maintained manually by patients, are now securely stored and accessed digitally.
- **Employee Management**: Streamlined employee management and pharmaceutical inventory control ensure precise record-keeping and operational efficiency.
  
The project revolutionizes dental surgery operations with a technology-driven approach to data management and healthcare provision.

## Features üîê
- **Captcha Integration**: Protects against bots.
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salting ensures secure password storage.
- **User Validation**: Stringent username and password validation (8-12 characters with capital letters, numbers, and special characters).
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevents malicious input, ensuring system integrity.
- **Parametrized SQL Queries**: Guards against SQL injection attacks.
- **Session Management**: Secure sessions with HTTPS, SameSite cookie attributes, and session timeout.
- **MongoDB for Logging**: Tracks user login attempts securely.
- **Database User Permissions**: Restricted access to the database based on user roles.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, Figma
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code, WAMP server
